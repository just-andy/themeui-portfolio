    <h1>About Andy</h1>
    <p>
      Please feel free to explore and find out what I’ve done for businesses big
      and small – and what I could do for you too. I won’t bore you with
      personal stuff – this is all about the work. However, some kind of potted
      CV is in order. So here goes:
    </p>

    <p>
      I have over 16 years’ experience with a wide variety of online projects
      (including seven years in online gaming/sports/betting sector). You’ll
      find a snapshot of them here.
    </p>

    <p>
      I love problem-solving UX/customer challenges; preferably working
      alongside product and dev teams - although I’m more than happy to fly solo
      if need be.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m always up for a challenge and am happy to discuss any opportunities or
      projects – so let’s talk.
